# My Very First Web Page

**Welcome**

*The following will provide you with a description of all the technologies I will be using.*
## Javascript

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

## CLOUD 9

Cloud9 contains a collection of tools that you use to code, build, run, test, debug, and release software in the cloud. To work with these tools, you use the AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment, or IDE. 
You access the AWS Cloud9 IDE through a web browser. The IDE offers a rich code-editing experience with support for several programming languages and runtime debuggers, as well as a built-in terminal. 
You can configure the IDE to your preferences. You can switch color themes, bind shortcut keys, enable programming language-specific syntax coloring and code formatting, and more. 

## GIT

Git is the most commonly used version control system today and is quickly becoming the standard for version control. Git is a distributed version control system, meaning your local copy of code is a complete version control repository. These fully-functional local repositories make it is easy to work offline or remotely. You commit your work locally, and then sync your copy of the repository with the copy on the server. This paradigm differs from centralized version control where clients must synchronize code with a server before creating new versions of code.

## GIT HUB

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.

The flagship functionality of GitHub is “forking” – copying a repository from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo.

## PYTHON

Python is a general-purpose programming language which can be used for a wide variety of applications. A great language for beginners because of its readability and other structural elements designed to make it easy to understand, Python is not limited to basic usage. In fact, it powers some of the world's most complex applications and website.

Python is an interpreted language, meaning that programs written in Python don't need to be compiled in advance in order to run, making it easy to test small snippets of code and making code written in Python easier to move between platforms. Since Python is most operating systems in common use, Python is a universal language found in a variety of different applications.

## FLASK

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.[3] It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program. 
Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest, LinkedIn, and the community web page for Flask itself.

## MONGO DB

MongoDB’s document model is simple for developers to learn and use, while still providing all the capabilities needed to meet the most complex requirements at any scale. We provide drivers for 10+ languages, and the community has built dozens more.

MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. This means it is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use. 

## MySQL

MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is developed, distributed and supported by Oracle Corporation. Like other relational systems, MySQL stores data in tables and uses structured query language (SQL) for database access. In MySQL, you pre-define your database schema based on your requirements and set up rules to govern the relationships between fields in your tables. In MySQL, related information may be stored in separate tables, but associated through the use of joins. In this way, data duplication is minimized.

## DJANGO

At its core, Django is a high-level, MVC-style, open-source collection of libraries written in Python, and one of the most popular server-side web frameworks out there. It’s motto is Don’t repeat yourself. Like Python, it emphasizes efficiency, allowing you to do as much as possible with as little coding as possible. Django’s major features are all meant to be decoupled, allowing the developers to pick and choose which pieces of functionality are right for their project. The result is more streamlined code and improved performance.

Thousands of websites are currently using Django, from daily newspapers to social media and sharing sites to major foundations and nonprofits. Since Django was originally developed for use in the newsroom, it’s no surprise that major daily publications like the Washington Post and The Guardian rely on it. Startups like Eventbrite and Disqus have relied on Django to scale quickly, while social media behemoths like Instagram and Pinterest have used it to power their dynamic web apps.

## HEROKU

Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. Our platform is elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers the simplest path to getting their apps to market. This platform is giving developers the freedom to focus on their core product without the distraction of maintaining servers, hardware, or infrastructure. The Heroku experience provides services, tools, workflows, and polyglot support—all designed to enhance developer productivity.
